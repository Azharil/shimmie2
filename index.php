Currently Shimmie 2 doesn't support versions of PHP lower than 5.0.0. Please
either upgrade your PHP, or tell Shish that PHP 4 support is a big deal for
you...
<!--
This version of Shimmie does not support versions lower than 5.0.0, however
you can create a version that does by using the u_create_monolith.php script.
This will read all the files in core/, events/ and ext/, strip the PHP 5 bits
out, and write a file called monolith.php. Monolith contains all the core
Shimmie code (not themes or config files), and can be used as a replacement
for index.php.
